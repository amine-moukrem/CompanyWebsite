# Company Website


This project simulates a website for a company that sells products. Users can go use the cart function to save products and complete the checkout process the way they would on a real online store.

## About
The project was created using ASP.Net, with C# as the backend language. The cart function works through the use of cookies. Data is written to and read from a MS SQL Server database.


## Example use:

![Alt text](example-images/ex-img01.png?raw=true "Example 1")
![Alt text](example-images/ex-img02.png?raw=true "Example 2")
